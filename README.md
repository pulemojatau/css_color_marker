This project is part of the freeCodeCamp CSS course([Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)), where I built a set of colored markers. The project focuses on learning different ways to set color values and how to pair colors effectively to enhance the aesthetic appeal of a webpage.
